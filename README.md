## Built By [Neal Waga](https://github.com/nealwaga/)

## Description
This is an internship coding test that consists of three questions each in its own file.

***

## User Stories 
These are the behaviors/features that the application implements for use by a user.
1. The first question is to write a function that will take input from the user and check if it is palindrome. If the word is not palindrome then return it in the reverse order. For example "hello" is not a palindrome and it should return "elloh"
2. The second question has an array of first 45 numbers with one missing number. I need to find a missing integer from the list. Written in JavaScript.
3. The third question is to complete the code to make a JavaScript based digital clock.
